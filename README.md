Heart Rate & PPG Data Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets for analyzing heart rate and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals.  
It includes preprocessing, data exploration, and analysis of subject-level recordings across 20 participants.

# Repository Structure

Notebooks
  heart_project.ipynb – main project notebook
  heart_rate.ipynb – heart rate–specific analysis
  ppg.ipynb – PPG signal analysis
  new.ipynb – experimental or draft notebooks

Data
  subject_1.csv … subject_20.csv – individual subject recordings  
  master_data.csv – combined dataset  
  merged_ppg_data.csv – merged PPG signals  

Environment
.venv/ – local Python virtual environment


Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.  
Create a virtual environment and install required packages.


## Data

This repository includes subject-level CSV files (`subject_1.csv` … `subject_20.csv`) representing raw PPG/heart rate recordings.
It also includes combined datasets (`master_data.csv`, `merged_ppg_data.csv`) for aggregated analysis
